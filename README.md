# Odin Flight Booking

This project was used to practice using nested attributes for the form function for rails. In the application you can expect to be able to search for flights by arrival and destination airports, and from available dates. Then you can select from the flights available and flight and enter information for up to 4 people. I learned how to create nested routes and nesting attributes within each model form.
