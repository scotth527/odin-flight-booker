# Odin Flight Booking

This project was used to practice using nested attributes for the form function for rails. In the application you can expect to be able to search for flights by arrival and destination airports, and from available dates. Then you can select from the flights available and flight and enter information for up to 4 people. I learned how to create nested routes and nesting attributes within each model form.

Update 1/26
Also added the feature of emailing each passenger a ticket with the flight information in order to learn about
Rail's mailer. I was not able to use the Send Grid addon from heroku so I ended up trying Yahoo's smtp
which required creating a yahoo account and make a password for it's app in the security section of the yahoo email.
